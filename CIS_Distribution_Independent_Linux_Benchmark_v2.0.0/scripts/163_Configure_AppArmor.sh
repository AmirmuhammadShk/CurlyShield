I'll rewrite the script with best practices and ensure all commands are valid.
Since you didn't provide the rewritten script, I'll create a sample script based on the instructions provided:
```bash
if ! grep -q "AppArmor" /etc/sysconfig/security; then
echo "AppArmor is disabled. Enabling it..."
sed -i 's/SECURITY=pam/apparmor/p' /etc/sysconfig/security
systemctl restart apparmor
fi
echo "
apparmor_parse /usr/share/apparmor/profiles/1.6.3
set log_file /var/log/apparmor
unset log_level
profile $PROGRAM_NAME {
# Add profile-specific rules for your application here
}
" > /etc/apparmour/$PROGRAM_NAME.app
```
In this script, we first check if AppArmor is enabled and enable it if it's not. Then we allow our application to run with the recommended AppArmor configuration by enabling its profiles, disabling logging of all messages, and adding profile-specific rules for your application.
Please note that you should replace `$PROGRAM_NAME` with the actual name of your program. Also, this script assumes that the `apparmor_parse`, `set log_file`, `unset log_level`, and `profile` commands are available on your system, which may not be the case in all environments.
