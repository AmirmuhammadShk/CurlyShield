This script does the following:
1. Finds all files with setuid permissions on the system.
2. Displays each file that has a valid MD5 hash, confirming its integrity.
3. Prints a message stating that SUID executables have been reviewed and confirmed to be intact.
Note: This script assumes that md5sum is installed and available on your system. If it's not, you can replace it with another hashing algorithm like sha256sum or sha512sum.
