Alternatively, the address argument can be a valid host DNS name. \nThe mask argument expressed in dotted-quad form defaults to 255.255.255.255, \nmeaning that the address is treated as the address of an individual host. A default entry \n(address 0.0.0.0, mask 0.0.0.0) is always included and is always the first entry in the \nlist. Note: the text string default, with no mask option, may be used to indicate the \ndefault entry. \nThe ippeerlimit directive limits the number of peer requests for each IP to int, where a \nvalue of -1 means \"unlimited\", the current default. A value of 0 means \"none\". There \nwould usually be at most 1 peering request per IP, but if the remote peering requests \nare behind a proxy there could well be more than 1 per IP. In the current \nimplementation, flag always restricts access, i.e., an entry with no flags indicates that \nfree access to the server is to be given. \nThe flags are not orthogonal, in that more restrictive flags will often make less restrictive \nones redundant. The flags can generally be classed into two categories, those which \nrestrict time service and those which restrict informational queries and attempts to do \nrun-time reconfiguration of the server. \nPage 260 \nOne or more of the following flags may be specified: \n\u2022 kod - If this flag is set when an access violation occurs, a kiss-o'-death (KoD) \npacket is sent. KoD packets are rate limited to no more than one per second. If \nanother KoD packet occurs within one second after the last one, the packet is \ndropped. \n\u2022 limited - Deny service if the packet spacing violates the lower limits specified in \nthe discard command. A history of clients is kept using the monitoring capability \nof ntpd. Thus, monitoring is always active as long as there is a restriction entry \nwith the limited flag. \n\u2022 lowpriotrap - Declare traps set by matching hosts to be low priority. The number \nof traps a server can maintain is limited (the current limit is 3). Traps are usually \nassigned on a first come, first served basis, with later trap requestors being \ndenied service. This flag modifies the assignment algorithm by allowing low \npriority traps to be overridden by later requests for normal priority traps. \n\u2022 noepeer - Deny ephemeral peer requests, even if they come from an \nauthenticated source. Note that the ability to use a symmetric key for \nauthentication may be restricted to one or more IPs or subnets via the third field \nof the ntp.keys file. This restriction is not enabled by default, to maintain \nbackward compatibility. Expect noepeer to become the default in ntp-4.4. \n\u2022 nomodify - Deny ntpq and ntpdc queries which attempt to modify the state of the \nserver (i.e., run time reconfiguration). Queries which return information are \npermitted. \n\u2022 noquery - Deny ntpq and ntpdc queries. Time service is not affected. \n\u2022 nopeer - Deny unauthenticated packets which would result in mobilizing a new \nassociation. This includes broadcast and symmetric active packets when a \nconfigured association does not exist. It also includes pool associations, so if you \nwant to use servers from a pool directive and also want to use nopeer by default, \nyou'll want a restrict source ... line as well that does not include the nopeer \ndirective. \n\u2022 noserve - Deny all packets except ntpq and ntpdc queries. \n\u2022 notrap - Decline to provide mode 6 control message trap service to matching \nhosts. The trap service is a subsystem of the ntpq control message protocol \nwhich is intended for use by remote event logging programs. \n\u2022 notrust - Deny service unless the packet is cryptographically authenticated. \n\u2022 ntpport - This is actually a match algorithm modifier, rather than a restriction \nflag. Its presence causes the restriction entry to be matched only if the source \nport in the packet is the standard NTP UDP port (123). Both ntpport and non-\nntpport may be specified.
