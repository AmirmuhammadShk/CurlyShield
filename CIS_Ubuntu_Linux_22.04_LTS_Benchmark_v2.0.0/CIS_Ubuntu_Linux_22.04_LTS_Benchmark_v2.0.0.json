This bug has been resolved in 8.2p1 and thus it can no longer be abused \ndisconnect idle users. \nThe two options ClientAliveInterval and ClientAliveCountMax control the timeout of \nSSH sessions. Taken directly from man 5 sshd_config: \n\u2022 ClientAliveInterval Sets a timeout interval in seconds after which if no data \nhas been received from the client, sshd(8) will send a message through the \nencrypted channel to request a response from the client. The default is 0, \nindicating that these messages will not be sent to the client. \n\u2022 ClientAliveCountMax Sets the number of client alive messages which may be \nsent without sshd(8) receiving any messages back from the client. If this \nthreshold is reached while client alive messages are being sent, sshd will \ndisconnect the client, terminating the session. It is important to note that the use \nof client alive messages is very different from TCPKeepAlive. The client alive \nmessages are sent through the encrypted channel and therefore will not be \nspoofable. The TCP keepalive option en\u2010abled by TCPKeepAlive is spoofable. \nThe client alive mechanism is valuable when the client or server depend on \nknowing when a connection has become unresponsive. The default value is 3. If \nClientAliveInterval is set to 15, and ClientAliveCountMax is left at the default, \nunresponsive SSH clients will be disconnected after approximately 45 seconds. \nSetting a zero ClientAliveCountMax disables connection termination. \nPage 521 \nInternal Only - General \nRationale:",
