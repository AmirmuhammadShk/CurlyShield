find /etc/audit/ -type f \( -name '*.conf' -o -name '*.rules' \) ! -group root | xargs -I {} bash -c "chgrp root {}"
This script uses `find` to locate all configuration files in the `/etc/audit/` directory, excluding those that are already owned by the root group. It then pipes the output of `find` to `xargs`, which executes the `chgrp` command on each file, changing its owner to root. The `-I {}` option allows `xargs` to expand the `{}` placeholder into the actual filename, and the `bash -c` part is used to execute a shell command (in this case, `chgrp`) within a new shell for safety.
